## 🌷 Project Overview

This portfolio was designed to reflect both my technical skills and personality.  
Instead of a traditional minimal or corporate layout, I created a warm, cozy interface that feels inviting and human.

The goal was simple:

> Build a memorable developer portfolio that balances aesthetics, usability, and clean code architecture.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure
- **CSS3** — Custom styling, soft UI design & animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Form handling & interactivity
- **EmailJS** — Secure serverless contact form integration
- **Git** — Version control

---

## 💡 Why EmailJS Instead of a Backend?

For this portfolio, I intentionally chose a **serverless approach** using EmailJS instead of building a custom backend (PHP/Node).

### Why?

- Reduced infrastructure complexity
- No server maintenance
- Faster deployment
- Lightweight architecture
- Secure API-based email handling

This keeps the project focused on UX and presentation while maintaining professional workflow standards.

## ✨ Technical Highlights

- Custom JavaScript form validation
- Controlled button loading state (“Sending…” UX feedback)
- Prevented empty submissions
- Responsive design (desktop & mobile)
- Soft hover effects & micro-interactions
- Clean file structure
- No unnecessary dependencies

---

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

### 1️⃣ UX Feedback Consistency
**Challenge:**  
Default browser alerts felt too harsh for the cozy aesthetic.

**Solution:**  
Implemented custom success messaging and controlled button states to maintain emotional consistency in the UI.

---

### 2️⃣ Preventing Empty Form Submissions
**Challenge:**  
The form initially allowed incomplete submissions.

**Solution:**  
Added client-side JavaScript validation before triggering EmailJS to ensure proper data handling.

---

### 3️⃣ Balancing Aesthetic & Structure
**Challenge:**  
Maintaining clean, readable code while preserving a soft pastel theme.

**Solution:**  
Organized CSS into structured sections while applying consistent spacing, typography, and color harmony.

## 🌼 Development Philosophy

This project reflects my approach to development:

- Clean structure over unnecessary complexity  
- Intentional tool selection  
- Human-centered UI  
- Serverless architecture for small-scale apps  
- Clear documentation  

AI tools were used for refinement and idea structuring, while implementation, debugging, and design decisions were handled manually.
